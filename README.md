# Raspian
This is a brief, condensed 2 page toolbox I wish I had when I started navigating the Pi's Rasbian.
Why is it so hard to find summary information when venturing in to explore the Raspberry Pi?
Like all Big Daddy Toolboxes, this is to be downloaded, printed front/back, and laminated for quick reference.
Of course, there will be a version to review at www.wikipython.com, but the secure download is here on github.
